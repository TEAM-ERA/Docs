# EMERGENCY RESPONSE ASSISTANCE 
## MVP Scope
### Background
Emergencies, although can be managed, are inevitable in our everyday activities. Most of the emergency cases recorded at our health care centers were not reported prior getting to the hospital. The health centers find it difficult in responding to the few cases that were reported earlier. This is as a result of the nature of the street layout and naming in our country (Ghana). Ambulances find it difficult in locating victims in the various location, which sometimes leads to death. One of the things the health sector could do to enhance the response to emergencies, is to educate the general public on first aid tips and any other health tips. Unfortunately, there is no effective way to provide accurate up-to-date information on first aid and health tips. We believe there is approach to this.
### Technology
Emergency Response Assistance is a two-way system approach to solve the critical problems associated with the current emergency response system in Ghana.  
**Emergencies Response Assistant** an android app that enables user to report emergency cases with their accurate locations with just a click of button. Users can also get up-to-date health tips and first-aid procedures published in real time.  
**Emergencies Response Admin** a web-based tool that helps emergency unit to receive and respond to emergency cases reported. The tool also aids health authorities to publish health tips and first-aids procedures  
### Why this solution is needed.
**Educated | Learn:** Educating the general public on the various emergency cases and the appropriate first aid procedures is one of the pillars to enable us to deal with emergency cases. Emergency response assistance allows health authorities to publish health tips and first aid. Users get real time notifications of the post and learn. This technology let authorities publish and manage up-to-date tips and first aid procedure day-in-day-out.  
**Report | Respond:** With just a click user can send emergency report with their accurate locations generated automatically. Emergency unit will be notified. Calculations will be done on the victim’s location to generate the street name, distance and directions of the location. The real time messaging system included a system enables a secure communication between emergency unit and victim if necessary.  
### The Future Ahead
Emergency response assistance aims to help society to deal with emergencies effectively. A project that was initiated with the aim of addressing health emergencies only is now aiming to help society report and respond to all emergency cases (fire emergencies, security emergency, etc.). The project is open for ideas, comment, suggestions, critics and of course support from all individuals.&nbsp;
